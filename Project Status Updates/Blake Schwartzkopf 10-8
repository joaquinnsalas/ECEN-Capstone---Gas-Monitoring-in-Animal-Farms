I finished my subsystem introduction project. I fixed the traces and got some practice making a multi layered board. Produced gerber files and did a design check.

I also found more footprints I need and checked for accuracy. The outline for the schematic was made and the analog sensor subsheet and digital sensor subsheet.

Plan on finishing the schematic by adding the analog to digital converter and microcontroller this week.
