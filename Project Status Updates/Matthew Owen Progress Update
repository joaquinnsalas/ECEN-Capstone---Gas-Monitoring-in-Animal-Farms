Dowloaded and Installed Altium
  -Designed my Op Amp Design on Altium to make progress towards my Sub System Introduction Project
Finalized Conops report 
Met with Stavros to get clarificaiton regarding technical merit and scope of my subsystem. I finilized my plan of created a PCB that will take AC input from the wall and convertin git into DC to power the rest of the subsystems
Begun research on the rectifiers, transformers, and buck boost converts that I will need for my subsystem. Along with general research on the best way to implement what I need for my reqired subsayatem.

Went to animal farm with sponsor to see where and how device will be mounted and used.
Worked on schematics and footprints for transformer, rectifier, and buck boost on altium. 
Finished fsr,icd,validation plan, execution plan, and creating midterm presentation.
Continued learning how to use altium and working on the design of my simulation to verify my design for power subsystem.
