This week I did basic sensor and Altium research.
I helped write the ConOps report with my team. We made changes to our rough draft according to the needs of our sponsor. I wrote the analysis section and my subsystem section.
I created a document where I am working on sensor research. I finalized the list of gases we will be measuring with the sponsor. I figured out the average amount of gas (in ppm) of gases common in animal farms and their toxic levels. With this information I made a list of possible sensors we could use to review with the team for each gas.
I created the design for my non inverting amplifier for the subsystem project and watched the video on creating parts in Altium.
