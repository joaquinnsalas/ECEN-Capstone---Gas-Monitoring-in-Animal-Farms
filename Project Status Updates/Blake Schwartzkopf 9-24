I worked on the FSR and ICD. I clarified some final details on what gas sensors I will choose. Chose resistors that will be used to measure the output of the sensors and pull up resistors.
Added a temperature sensor and analog-digital converter to the design.

I plan to finish the FSR, ICD, validation plan, and schedule. I also plan on preparing for the presentation and finishing the subsystem project.
